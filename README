Why do we use JavaDocs
JavaDocs are used to create professional documentation for a Java project. 
They help users and developers understand the purpose, functionality, and usage of the code without having to read every line. 
In a project, we generate JavaDocs using special comments (/** ... */) placed above classes, methods, and variables to explain what they do.
Once generated, the JavaDocs create an HTML website that provides a clear and organized view of the code structure. 
This documentation can then be shared with others by hosting it on a website like GitHub Pages or saving it locally, so anyone using the project can easily navigate and understand how to use the different parts of the code.
